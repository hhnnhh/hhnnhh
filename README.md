### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Hannah. When I was a kid my favorite toy was the sieve. Now I find patterns in data. This is my sandpit :beach_umbrella: for models and bots I built for fun. My latest project is a [twitterbot](https://github.com/hhnnhh/twitterbot) which tweets daily parts of Kafkas diary âœ¨. 
My background is in psychology, linguistics and neuroscience :brain:, hence, finding structures in minds and brains. 

I love language, reading and writing and I like to play around with AI for Natural Language Generation in German. If you wanna have a look: I have trained a plain Tensorflow/Keras net ([Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Net](https://github.com/hhnnhh/LSTM_Recurrent_Neural_Net_JuliZeh)) from scratch with a novel, which, magically, happens to be able to generate lyrics in the style of German Dadaists, too ðŸ˜„ And I have fine-tuned a pretrained [GPT-2](https://github.com/hhnnhh/zeh_text_generation) to do the same which actually writes paragraphs of the novel in the style of my favorite German author ðŸ’¬

Also you'll find a pretty accurate [LSTM-RNN text classifier for obfuscated sentences](https://github.com/hhnnhh/obfuscated_text_classification_AI). Finally, I present a more straightforward predictive ML classifier trained on open data, which is able to anticipate whether a vehicle is likely going to pass or fail a vehicle emissions test in the future. This project was a recent collaboration with some great fellow data scientists ðŸ‘¯ from [WiMLDS](https://github.com/wimlds/berlin-ds-lab).
