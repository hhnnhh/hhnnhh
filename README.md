### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Hannah. When I was a kid my favorite toy was the sieve. Now I find patterns in data. This is my sandpit for machine learning and deep learning stuff âœ¨. 
My background is in psychology, linguistics and neuroscience :brain:, hence, finding structures in minds and brains. 

I love language, reading and writing and I like to play around with AI for Natural Language Generation in German. If you wanna have a look: I have trained a plain Tensorflow/Keras net (Long-Short-Term Recurrent Neural Net) from scratch, which, magically, happens to be able to generate lyrics in the style of German Dadaists, too ðŸ˜„ And have fine-tuned a pretrained GPT-2 to write paragraphs of novels in the style of my favorite German author ðŸ’¬

Also you'll find a pretty accurate LSTM-RNN text classifier for obfuscated sentences, and a more straightforward ML project I did recently in collaboration with some great data scientists ðŸ‘¯.  

ðŸ“« Do you want to chat or collaborate? :mega: twitter @HannahBohle or info@_insertmyname_.de.
